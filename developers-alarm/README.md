## Overview

### How to use

- Clone or Download the repository. In the folder `developers-alarm` you will see all the progam files.

- By default alarm time is set to 25 minutes. But you can change as per your needs. To change the alarm time you should modify the variable named `alarmTime` in the `app.js` file as follows:

```js
const alarmTime = 15; // change alarm time as you want
```
- To run the alarm app:
  1. Start you terminal in the `developers-alarm` folder
  2. Type `node ./app.js` and hit enter.
  3. Minimise the terminal and wait for the next alarm to take rest.

```
node ./app.js
```

This process will run till manual termination.
